**Candle Shop Receipt Generator**

This Java program creates receipts for a candle shop. It calculates the combined burn time, total cost per burn time, and overall price for a set of candles.

**Getting Started**
To use the program, make sure Java is installed on your computer. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the code repository.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the Java file's directory (Main.java).
3. Compile the Java file by typing: `javac Main.java`
4. Run the compiled program with: `java Main`

**How to Use**
The program is designed to generate receipts for a sample range of candles. You can edit or add candles by changing the details in the `main` method of the Main.java file.

**Output**
Running the program results in a formatted receipt showing each candle's specifics, such as name, quantity, burn time, cost per burn time, and price. It also calculates the total burn time, overall cost per burn time, and total price for all candles.

The receipt is displayed in an organized format in the console.

**Dependencies**
The program employs the java.text.DecimalFormat class from the Java standard library to format the cost per burn time to two decimal places.
